# Better Frost Walker

This mod makes the frost walker enchantment better.  

## Features
- **Sprint-Jumping** - Allows you to sprint-jump with frost walker.
- **Boats** - Riding boats while having frost walker boots equipped will generate frosted ice under your boat.
- **Lava Walker** - Frost walker will also freeze lava.
- **Higher level frost walker** - Allows you to enchant your boots with higher levels of frost walker.
- **Still Ice** - Frost walker will *still* generate new ice beneath you even when you stand *still*.
- **Standing on powdered snow** - Having frost walker on your boots will prevent you from falling through powdered snow, just like leather boots do.
- **Disable ice fall damage** - Falling on frosted ice with frost walker boots will negate fall damage. 
- **Always melt ice** - Makes frosted ice melt even when it's nighttime.
- **Configuration** - Most features are configurable by using the `/frostConfig` command in game.

## What about vanilla servers?

If you want the magma walker feature, the server and clients will both need to have the mod installed.

If you don't need walking on lava, you can use the `/frostConfig` command in game to set `serverSideOnly` to true.  
This will disable the lava walker feature, but now the clients won't need the mod to be installed.
